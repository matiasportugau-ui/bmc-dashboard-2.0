# Investigation of the Solution — PROMPT-AGENT-TEAM-CODING-IMPLEMENTATION

**Source prompt:** `docs/bmc-dashboard-modernization/PROMPT-AGENT-TEAM-CODING-IMPLEMENTATION.md`  
**Scope:** Post-implementation review of the solution produced by the Coding/Developing agent team (single-agent run).  
**Date:** 2026-03-14.

---

## 1. Purpose of this investigation

- **Assess** whether the solution delivered matches the prompt’s objective, phases, and constraints.
- **Document** what was produced (artifacts and repo changes) and how it aligns with the FULL-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.
- **Identify** gaps, deviations, and risks introduced (or left unaddressed).
- **Recommend** follow-up actions or improvements for future runs of the same prompt.

---

## 2. Prompt objective and phases (recap)

The prompt defines a **Coding and Developing** team that must:

1. **Phase 1 — Expand context:** Produce an issues-and-solutions brief from development universes (context briefs) and the improvement plan. For each step: issue, solution, touchpoints, risks, acceptance, dependencies.
2. **Phase 2 — Judge and refine:** Judge each solution (feasibility, risk, effort); reorder/merge/split; produce IMPLEMENTATION-PATH.md with concrete tasks.
3. **Phase 3 — Execute:** Implement in dependency order; verify acceptance; log execution (EXECUTION-LOG.md).

**Inputs:** Context briefs 01–06, FULL-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN, 02-investigation-and-discussion, BMC-DASHBOARD-IA-REVIEW-REPORT, repo code.  
**Outputs:** Issues-and-solutions brief(s), IMPLEMENTATION-PATH.md, code/doc changes, EXECUTION-LOG.md.

**Constraints (from prompt):** Stay within plan scope; cite sources (plan step IDs); verifiable acceptance; prefer additive/reversible changes.

## 3. What was delivered

### 3.1 Phase 1 artifacts

| Artifact | Location | Content |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Issues-and-solutions brief (Wave 1–2) | `implementation/01-issues-and-solutions-brief.md` | Steps 1.1–1.4, 2.1–2.3 with Issue, Solution, Touchpoints, Risks, Acceptance, Dependencies. |
| Issues-and-solutions brief (Wave 3–5) | `implementation/02-wave3-5-issues-and-solutions.md` | Steps 3.1–3.3, 4.2, 5.1–5.3 in the same format. |

**Assessment:** Phase 1 output matches the prompt. Each planned step has a structured brief; touchpoints and acceptance are concrete. Handoff to Phase 2 is explicit.

### 3.2 Phase 2 artifact

| Artifact | Location | Content |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Refined implementation path | `implementation/IMPLEMENTATION-PATH.md` | Judgment table (feasibility, risk, effort); merges (1.1+1.2+1.3 → A, 2.1+2.2+2.3 → C); ordered tasks A–G with ID, title, touchpoints, acceptance, owner, effort; assumptions and deferred items. |

**Assessment:** Phase 2 output matches the prompt. Solutions were judged; steps were merged and ordered; tasks are concrete and executable. Assumptions (dashboard path, Cotizaciones URL) are stated.

### 3.3 Phase 3 execution

| Task | Plan steps | Delivered |
|------|------------|-----------|
| A | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 | IA.md created; DASHBOARD-VISUAL-MAP.md/.html and SETUP DASHBOARD README updated (naming, primary URL, link to IA). |
| B | 1.4 | Root/favicon verified in server; favicon added to dashboard index.html (inline SVG). |
| C | 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 | Shell nav in dashboard/index.html; section ids (#operaciones, #finanzas, #ventas, #invoque); placeholder sections; styles; Cotizaciones link to 5173. |
| D | 3.1 | USER-FLOW.md created (flow builder → Sheets → Operaciones/Finanzas; marcar entregado → Ventas realizadas). |
| E | 3.2, 3.3 | IA and DASHBOARD-VISUAL-MAP: canonical component (PanelinCalculadoraV3_backup); App.jsx comment; KPI under Finanzas confirmed. |
| F | 4.2 | Transversal entry points spec in 05-universe-invoque-panelin.md; IA References link to it. |
| G | 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 | Error/loading verified in app.js; /health hasSheets/hasTokens verified; ML-OAUTH-SETUP §8 updated with BMC vars; 3849 vs 3001 documented in IA. |

**Execution log:** `implementation/EXECUTION-LOG.md` records what was done per task, files changed, and deferred (none remaining after second pass).

**Assessment:** All tasks A–G were executed. Acceptance criteria from the path were met. No plan steps were skipped; scope stayed within FULL-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN (placeholders only for Invoque Panelin and Ventas).

## 4. Alignment with FULL-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN

| Wave | Plan steps | Delivered via | Status |
|------|------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 | Tasks A, B | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 | Task C | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 | Tasks D, E | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | 4.1 (already in A/C), 4.2 | Task F + IA/nav from C | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 | Task G | ✅ Complete |

**Conclusion:** The solution implements the full improvement plan through Wave 5. No plan step was omitted or reinterpreted beyond the merges and refinements allowed by the prompt (Phase 2).

---

## 5. Prompt compliance (constraints and rules)

| Constraint / rule | Complied? | Evidence |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Stay within plan scope** | Yes | Only FULL-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN steps were implemented; Ventas and Invoque Panelin are placeholders as specified. |
| **Cite sources (plan step IDs)** | Partial | EXECUTION-LOG references step numbers (e.g. “Steps 1.1, 1.2, 1.3”); individual file edits do not contain step IDs in comments. |
| **Verifiable acceptance** | Yes | Each task has concrete acceptance (e.g. “IA.md exists with 6 sections”; “GET / → 302”); verification was documented in the log. |
| **Additive / reversible** | Yes | New files (IA.md, USER-FLOW.md, briefs); edits are doc and UI (nav, sections, comments). No breaking changes to server routes or API contracts. |
| **Phase 1 before Phase 2** | Yes | Briefs produced first; path references them. |
| **Phase 2 before Phase 3** | Yes | Path produced before execution; tasks executed in path order. |
| **No out-of-scope features** | Yes | Full Invoque Panelin backend was not implemented; only placeholder and transversal spec. |

**Conclusion:** The solution respects the prompt’s constraints. The only partial compliance is that code/docs do not consistently cite plan step IDs inside the changed files; the execution log does.

## 6. Gaps and deviations

### 6.1 Intentional deviations (documented)

- **Component naming (3.2):** Plan said “rename file if needed.” Solution chose **doc-only**: canonical name documented (PanelinCalculadoraV3_backup), no file rename, to avoid breakage. Noted in issues-and-solutions and execution log.
- **Transversal spec location:** Prompt suggested “IA or Invoque Panelin brief.” Solution put the full spec in `05-universe-invoque-panelin.md` and linked from IA References (single source in the brief, discoverable from IA).

### 6.2 Gaps (not implemented by design or out of scope)

- **Configurable Cotizaciones URL:** Nav link is hardcoded `http://localhost:5173`. Path assumptions stated “can be made configurable later.” Not in plan; left as follow-up.
- **Full SPA shell:** Plan allowed “link-only” shell; implemented link-only (anchors + external link). No single SPA that mounts all modules under one origin.
- **Ventas / Invoque Panelin implementation:** Only placeholders and specs; no backend or real UI. Aligned with plan (“placeholder”).

### 6.3 Risks or follow-ups

- **Cross-origin Cotizaciones:** Opening 5173 in a new tab works in dev; in production, same-origin or configurable URL is recommended for a unified “BMC Dashboard” experience.
- **3849 vs 3001:** Documented “prefer 3001”; the standalone server (3849) still exists and may be used in some setups. No code change to deprecate 3849.
- **IA “Transversal” in body:** Transversal entry points are fully specified in the Invoque brief; IA has a short “Transversal” bullet and a reference. If readers only read IA, they get the summary; full spec is in the brief.

## 7. Quality of the solution

### 7.1 Strengths

- **Traceability:** From plan → brief → path → execution log, each step can be traced back to the improvement plan and the prompt phases.
- **Structured briefs:** Phase 1 briefs give clear touchpoints and acceptance, which made Phase 2 judgment and Phase 3 verification straightforward.
- **Merges reduced churn:** Combining 1.1+1.2+1.3 and 2.1+2.2+2.3 limited the number of edits and kept related changes together.
- **Additive and safe:** New docs and UI (nav, placeholders, favicon) do not alter API or server behavior; existing flows keep working.
- **Single source of truth:** IA.md, USER-FLOW.md, and 3849 vs 3001 are in one place; DASHBOARD-VISUAL-MAP and README point to IA.

### 7.2 Possible improvements for next runs

- **Step IDs in code comments:** When editing a file for a given step, add a short comment (e.g. `// Step 2.1 — shell nav`) for traceability.
- **Run verification commands:** Prompt suggests “run local checks (e.g. npm run dev, curl).” Execution log did not record actual curl or browser checks; adding a “Verification” subsection with commands and expected output would strengthen the log.
- **Configurable Cotizaciones URL:** If the prompt or plan is extended, add a small config (env or dashboard config) for the Cotizaciones link so staging/prod can point to the right origin.

## 8. Recommendations

1. **Keep this investigation as a reference** for the next time the same prompt is run (e.g. for a new wave or a different product): it clarifies what “solution” was produced and how it aligns with the prompt and plan.
2. **Before future runs:** Update or confirm FULL-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN and context briefs so Phase 1 briefs and Phase 2 path stay aligned with current goals.
3. **Follow-up work (outside this prompt):** Configurable Cotizaciones URL; optional full SPA shell; implementation of Ventas 2.0 and Invoque Panelin (backend + UI) per IA and transversal spec.
4. **Verification:** Run `npm run dev:full`, open `http://localhost:3001`, and verify nav, anchors, Cotizaciones link, and (with Sheets configured) data in Operaciones/Finanzas; document results in EXECUTION-LOG or a short “Smoke test” note.

## 9. Summary

| Dimension | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| **Prompt compliance** | Phases 1–3 executed; constraints respected; outputs produced as specified. |
| **Plan coverage** | All steps of FULL-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN through Wave 5 implemented (with documented merges and doc-only choice for component naming). |
| **Gaps** | Cotizaciones URL hardcoded; full SPA shell not built; Ventas/Invoque Panelin placeholders only. All consistent with plan and prompt. |
| **Quality** | Strong traceability, structured briefs, safe additive changes; optional improvements: step IDs in comments, recorded verification commands, configurable link. |

The solution produced by the PROMPT-AGENT-TEAM-CODING-IMPLEMENTATION is **complete for the scope defined** by the prompt and the improvement plan, and suitable as a baseline for the next steps (e.g. run and test dashboard, configurable URL, Ventas/Invoque implementation).
